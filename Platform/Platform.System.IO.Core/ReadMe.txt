Links File System

Prototype: https://github.com/philipl/pifs (πfs)

Possible alternative (similar to https://libraryofbabel.info/):
1. Define rules for calculating link position in all links set (this set always exists, but can take an infinite time to travel through it).
2. Make a search/match algorithm.

Difine a rule for translating each of possible states of links database into a single number or path to value position.
